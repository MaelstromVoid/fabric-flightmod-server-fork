## Creative Flight Mod

Client mod that modifies creative flight mechanics. [Download from CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flight-mod-fabric/files/all)

Main feature of this mod is adjusting movement so that it matches the looking direction when flying up or down.

It has three modes:

- vanilla - disabled
- vanilla vertical - keep vanilla vertical speed and adjusts only horizontal movement
- full speed - increase vertical speed to match horizontal movement (may be considered as unfair advantage on your server)

Other features are:

- inertia compensation
- more natural flight toggle

**All features are disabled by default.** Settings are stored per-server and are accessible from [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/third-person-crosshair-fabric) screen.
