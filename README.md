## Creative Flight Mod

Client mod that modifies creative flight mechanics. [Download from CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flight-mod-fabric/files/all)

Main feature of this mod is adjusting movement so that it matches the looking direction when flying up or down. Other features are: inertia compensation and elytra-like fly activation.

Movement adjustment in survival mode has three variants:

- vanilla - no adjustment
- vanilla vertical - keep vanilla vertical speed and adjusts only horizontal movement
- full speed (default) - move up or down at full fly speed

Configuration menu can be accessed from [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/third-person-crosshair-fabric) screen. It is there for minecraft servers that have flying enabled but may consider some features of this mod cheating.
